# automated-browser-search-tool
# üîç Automated Google Search Tool using Selenium

A simple yet powerful Python script that uses Selenium to automate Google searches based on user input.

##  Features

- Takes a search query from the user
- Opens Google in Chrome browser
- Automatically types the query and hits Enter
- Keeps the browser open after execution (thanks to `detach=True`)
- Fast and lightweight

##  Technologies Used

- Python 
- Selenium WebDriver
- Chrome Browser

- ## Note:
- Google may show a reCAPTCHA on some runs. Manual verification might be needed ‚Äî this is a natural limitation when automating real-world browsers with Selenium

  if anybody can enhance this in terms of UI or AI integrations with LLMS, I would love to collaborate with them!
